Some marches have been cancelled, big sponsors like the southern poverty law center are pulling out and local organizers are trying to distance themselves from D.C. leaders like Tamika Mallory, Carmen Perez, Bob Bland and Linda Sarsour. However, there are still plenty of activists and a few organizations, like Planned Parenthood, who say they will show up to support the march and its leaders. So can the core movement that was born out of reactionary resistance to President Trump survive the infighting and controversy it has endured over the past year? We speak to Vanessa Wruble, a former national organizer for the women’s march, to find out how the movement is evolving.",
